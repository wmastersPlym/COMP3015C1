###Initial Prototype
 
### Versions

	- Version 1909

### How it works
Works using opengl to create a 3D model with custom shaders using the blinn-phong lighting model, with multiple light sources.

### How the code fit together
scenebasic_uniform.cpp is essentially the main file (other than the shader files) that puts together all the extra libaries and additional files.  It contains functions that sets up the main scene, renders the 3D model and sets all the value for the shaders.
